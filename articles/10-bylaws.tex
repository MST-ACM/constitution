\subsection{Dues}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item	Dues are set to be $\$11$ for one semester and $\$20$ for two semesters.
  \item	Dues must be paid at the beginning of the semester after which your
    previous payment expires. All dues are paid to the standing treasurer, or
    standing President, if by hand, or through the website, if digitally.
  \item If an ACM Member does not pay dues during the first two weeks of the
    semester following expiration of previous payment, they will be deemed no
    longer an ACM Member and thus, all rights given to ACM Members will be
    revoked.
  \item If a member of the Executive Board does not pay, they will also be
    unable to vote, in both elections and discussions of the Board. They will,
    however, remain on the Executive Board until the end of the semester, and if
    they still refuse to pay, will be relieved of their position, leaving a
    vacancy.
\end{enumerate}
