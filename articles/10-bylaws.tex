\subsection{Dues}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item	Dues are set to be $\$11$ for one semester and $\$20$ for two semesters.
    A student can pay for a membership at any point in the semester and their
    membership expiration date will be set 6 months and 12 months from the date
    in which they pay, respectively.
  \item	All dues will be payed to the Standing President, Standing Treasurer, or
    a digital medium.
  \item If an ACM Member does not pay dues during the first two weeks of the
    semester following the expiration of the previous payment or by the time of
    their recorded membership expiration date, whichever occurs later, they will
    be deemed no longer an ACM Member and thus, all rights given to ACM Members
    will be revoked.
  \item If a member of the Executive Board does not pay, they will also be
    unable to vote, in both elections and discussions of the Board. They will,
    however, remain on the Executive Board until the end of the semester, and if
    they still refuse to pay, will be relieved of their position, leaving a
    vacancy.
\end{enumerate}
