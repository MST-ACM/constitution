\section{VI \textendash{} Committees}
New chairs are decided entirely by the committee, whether by the
current chair or by vote of the committee body. If there is ever a
span with no chair, a vote will occur within the S\&T Executive Board
to dissolve the committee. The vote will be done as simple majority.
