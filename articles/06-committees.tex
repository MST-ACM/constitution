\section{VI \textendash{} Committees}
Committees are groups that aim to help ACM achieve and expand its overall mission
by adhering to specific goals and interests. These committees operate
independently from ACM as long as their actions and interest do not conflict or
compete with ACM or other committees. Committees must have a chair, but may
internally have their own election procedures, governance structure, and
operating procedures. If there is ever a span with no chair, a vote simple
majority vote will occur within the S\&T Executive Board to dissolve the
committee.

  \item Temporary committees
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Temporary committees serve to accomplish long-term ACM projects or
        needs that may not fall under the purview or interest of a specific
        committee. The temporary committee follows the same operating procedures
        as committees mentioned above; however, temporary committee chairs do
        not share the voting rights of committee chairs and are not included in
        Executive Board majority.
      \item Temporary committees can be formed at the discretion of the
        President, Vice President, or a simple majority vote of the Executive
        Board.
      \item Temporary committees will last for a maximum of one year. If the
        temporary committee is necessary after one year, the Executive Board
        must make a constitutional amendment to convert the temporary committee
        to a standing committee.
