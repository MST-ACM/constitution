\section{VI \textendash{} Committees}
Committees are group that aim to help ACM achieve and expand its overall mission
by adhering to specific goals and interests. These committees operate
independently from ACM as long as their actions and interest do not conflict or
compete with ACM or other committees. Committees must have a chair, but may
internally have their own election procedures, governance structure, and
operating procedures. If there is ever a span with no chair, a vote will occur
within the S\&T Executive Board to dissolve the committee. The vote will be done
as simple majority.

        committee. The temporary committee follows the same operating procedures
        as committees mentioned above.
      \item Temporary committees can be formed at the discretion of the
        President, Vice President, or a simple majority vote of the executive
        board.
      \item Temporary committees will last for a maximum of one year. If the
        temporary committee is necessary after one year, the executive board
        must make a constitutional amendment to convert the temporary committee
        to a standing committee.
