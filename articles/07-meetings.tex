\begin{enumerate}
  \item	Types of meetings
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Executive: Executive Meetings happen weekly, and are for discussing
      all ACM affairs. Discussions include but are not limited to affairs of
      sponsorships, events, constitution, and any other business. Anyone may attend.
      \item	Talks: Any event with which ACM hosts a company to come meet with
      students. Happens irregularly. Anyone may attend.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Quorum is required for any executive votes to be enacted. For elections,
    there is no quorum for the body. The Executive Board must have at least all
    but two members present for quorum. If quorum does not exist, the vote will
    be tabled to the next meeting.
  \item Meetings will not use a strict parliamentary authority for general
    discussion points and conversation. The President or VP-I may enact Robert's
    Rules of Order at any point at their discretion.  All votes will be made
    using Robert’s Rules of Order.
\end{enumerate}
