\begin{enumerate}
  \item	Types of meetings
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Executive: Executive Meetings happen weekly, and are for discussing
      all ACM affairs. Discussions include but are not limited to affairs of
      sponsorships, events, constitution, and any other business. Anyone may attend.
      \item	Talks: Any event with which ACM hosts a company to come meet with
      students. Happens irregularly. Anyone may attend.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Quorum is required for any executive votes to be enacted. For elections,
  there is no quorum for the body. To have quorum, the Executive Board must have
  at least all but two members present. If quorum does not exist, the vote will
  be tabled to the next meeting.
  \item Meetings will not use a strict parliamentary authority for general
  discussion points and conversation. The President or VP-I may enact Robert's
  Rules of Order at any point at their discretion using the safe-word
  "lavender". This should be used when things get heated, or chaotic. All votes
  will be made using Robertâ€™s Rules of Order.
\end{enumerate}
