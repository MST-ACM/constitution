\section{VII - Dues}
Note:  In this section specify whether or not your organization has dues.  If
your organization has dues, in this section it should be specified how the
amount of dues is determined (i.e. vote, national organization, etc.).  It
should also specify when dues are paid, whom they are paid to, and any
consequences that may result from dues not being paid.  Should failure to pay
dues result in a certain membership status (i.e. inactive or non-voting), the
membership category will need to be listed in the membership section of the
constitution.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item	(Specify how dues are determined)
