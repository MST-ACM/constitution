  \item Define election process for officers
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Elections will occur once in an academic year during the spring
      semester. Nominations will begin in the first week of April.
      \item Nominations will be made through an online form available to all ACM
      members and committee members. The nomination period shall last one week
      from when the public announcement is emailed to all persons on the ACM
      general email list.
      \item Election announcements will happen the day that nominations go live,
      and again three days following that first announcement. Once nominations
      close, there will be an announcement with the list of nominees. A time and
      date will be included in that announcement with details for the meeting
      which will include the election. All announcements will occur as emails to
      the ACM mailing list, as well as to all of the committee group chats.
      \item Voting will occur in person and will be done with secret ballot. At
      the election, each nominee will be called up to speak on their experience
      and answer questions from the body. ACM Members will be able to vote
      except the president of the Executive Board. The winner will be calculated
      with simple majority. If there is a tie, all candidates not involved in
      the tie will be removed from the ballot and votes will be cast again, if
      there are only two candidates, the president will be allowed to vote and
      decide. In the case of a sole candidate, the ballot will list two options,
      the candidate, and no confidence, which will indicate a vote against the candidate.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item If a vacancy should arise, either by an elected officer leaving, or by
  no consensus in a vote, the following procedure must be followed. The
  Executive Board will be responsible for the election of an interim. This will
  happen by members of the Board nominating persons for the position, and a vote
  taking place that requires a simple majority of the Executive Board to vote in
  favor. Members of the Executive Board will be given the option of voting for,
  or no confidence. After an interim is in place, an online form will be sent
  out to the ACM Members, and if the members confirm the interim, they will
  become officially part of the board.
