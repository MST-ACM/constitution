\subsection{Define election process for officers}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
  \item Elections will occur once per academic year during the spring semester.
    Nominations will begin the last week of March.
  \item Nominations will be made through an online form available to all ACM
    members and committee members. The nomination period shall last one week
    from when the public announcement is communicated.
  \item Once nominations close, there will be an announcement with the list of
    nominees and the time, date, and location of the official elections to all
    voting members.
  \item Voting will occur in person and will be done with secret ballot. At the
    election, each nominee will be given 5 minutes to speak on their experience
    and answer questions from the body. All ACM Members will be able to vote except
    the President of the Executive Board. The winner will be calculated with
    approval voting.
  \item If there is a tie, the current Executive board will leave the room and
    vote in private by simple majority which candidate will be elected. The
    Executive Board may also vote for no confidence, signaling a vacancy in the
    position.
  \item In the case of a sole candidate, the ballot will list two options: the
    candidate and no confidence which will indicate a vote against the
    candidate. Election will be a success if there are more approval than no
    confidence votes. Otherwise, the position will be considered a vacancy.
  \item If a vacancy should arise, the Executive Board will be responsible for
    the election of an interim. Members of the Executive Board will nominate
    willing people for the position and vote for each position by simply
    majority vote of Executive Board members. After an interim is in place for
    two weeks, an online form will be sent out to the ACM Members to confirm or
    deny the interim. The Executive Board may also choose by a 2/3s vote to host
    an official election following the process above to fill the vacancy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Method of impeachment}\label{sec:officers:impeachment}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
  \item An officer may be impeached for violating S\&T ACM's Rules and
    Regulations outline in Section \ref{sec:rules_and_regulations}.
  \item The impeachment process starts when the person who wishes to impeach
    an officer (`accuser') speaks with an advisor of ACM or an advisor of
    any standing committee of ACM. The accuser must draft a formal letter of
    grievances with evidence or examples of specific violations. The accuser will
    present this letter of grievances to the advisor in an official meeting
    and discuss with the advisor the specific violations. The advisor will
    then determine if there is a valid complaint according to the Rules and
    Regulations. If the complaint is valid, the advisor will set up a
    meeting between all advisors in ACM (including standing committees) to
    discuss the impeachment. The accuser and the accused will be invited to
    this meeting one week before the meeting takes place. The accused will
    received a copy of the formal complaint letter at this time. The accuser and
    the accused will be given 5 minutes to speak and make their case.
  \item The advisors will then privately discuss the case and vote to impeach
    the officer. Three or more advisors must be present and the vote must be
    unanimous. In the case that three or more advisors are not available, the
    department chair will be asked to make the decision with any available
    advisors. If the department chair is unavailable or unwilling, then the
    compliant will be brought up to Missouri S\&T Student Life.
\end{enumerate}
