The essential officers may at their discretion create non-essential officer
positions to delegate tasks to as they see fit. Officers must be Members who are
currently enrolled Students. Election of officers shall take place every year.
All officers shall be elected near the end of the spring semester and shall
begin their term in office effective May 1st. Should a position on the Executive
Council become open during the year, nominations shall be held at the first
meeting following the position becoming open and shall remain open for a week.
An election shall be held at the second meeting following the position becoming
open and shall remain open for a week. A person may hold the office of President
or Vice-President only if he/she is a member who is at least a Junior by
credit-hours during the year in which he/she serves. Nominations will be held at
the second to last meeting of the Spring semester by method of general floor
nomination or by electronic submission if done electronically. The list of
nominations shall he published along with the notice for the last meeting of the
Spring semester. Election of officers for the following academic year shall take
place at the last meeting of the Spring semester. The voting shall be by secret
ballot, starting at the position of President and working downward in rank.
Those members running for the current office shall be allowed time for a short
speech, and then asked to leave the room while the voting takes place. If the
voting takes place electronically, each candidate will submit a bio to be place
online with the ballot instead of giving a short speech. The votes will then be
counted if done in person or revealed if done electronically. In the event that
the membership wishes to impeach an officer or advisor, the impeachment
proceeding must be initiated by a unanimous decision from the remaining members
of the executive board, or in the case of the Advisor, all executive board
members. If an officer is being impeached, a written list of charges must then
be brought to the Advisor, who will review the written charges and make a
decision whether to proceed with the impeachment process. The matter will then
be announced to the membership in the formal meeting announcement, and voted on
at the next meeting. The Advisor must be present at the impeachment meeting and
the written charges must be presented to the general membership. The accused
will then be given the opportunity to make a rebuttal, and a vote will then be
taken. The impeachment must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the voting
membership.
