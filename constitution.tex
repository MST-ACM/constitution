The essential officers may at their discretion create non-essential officer positions to delegate tasks to as they see fit.
Officers must be Members who are currently enrolled Students.
Election of officers shall take place every year. All officers shall be elected near the end of the spring semester and shall begin their term in office effective May 1st.
Should a position on the Executive Council become open during the year, nominations shall be held at the first meeting following the position becoming open and shall remain open for a week. An election shall be held at the second meeting following the position becoming open and shall remain open for a week.
A person may hold the office of President or Vice-President only if he/she is a member who is at least a Junior by credit-hours during the year in which he/she serves.
Nominations will be held at the second to last meeting of the Spring semester by method of general floor nomination or by electronic submission if done electronically. The list of nominations shall he published along with the notice for the last meeting of the Spring semester.
Election of officers for the following academic year shall take place at the last meeting of the Spring semester. The voting shall be by secret ballot, starting at the position of President and working downward in rank. Those members running for the current office shall be allowed time for a short speech, and then asked to leave the room while the voting takes place. If the voting takes place electronically, each candidate will submit a bio to be place online with the ballot instead of giving a short speech. The votes will then be counted if done in person or revealed if done electronically. 
In the event that the membership wishes to impeach an officer or advisor, the impeachment proceeding must be initiated by a unanimous decision from the remaining members of the executive board, or in the case of the Advisor, all executive board members. If an officer is being impeached, a written list of charges must then be brought to the Advisor, who will review the written charges and make a decision whether to proceed with the impeachment process. The matter will then be announced to the membership in the formal meeting announcement, and voted on at the next meeting. The Advisor must be present at the impeachment meeting and the written charges must be presented to the general membership. The accused will then be given the opportunity to make a rebuttal, and a vote will then be taken. The impeachment must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the voting membership.
